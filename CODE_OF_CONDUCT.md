# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as group members and contributors to this coursework pledge to 
follow all of the standards and work hard in order to create a
welcoming and peaceful environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being respectful and paying attention to every group memberâ€™s opinion.
* Using appropriate language, not raising your voice and no swearing.
* Being on time for all of the meetings.
* Doing all of the tasks on time, not waiting for the last moment.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of words that are unappropriate such as swear words.
* Harrasing other group members.
* Being late for a group meeting.

## Our Punishments
*	If someone is late, they have to buy every other member chocolate.
*	If someone interrupts another group member, they have to buy chocolate.
*	If someone is texting/playing on their phone, they have to turn it off and put it in a box and buy chocolate. 


## Our Responsibilities

We are responsible to follow our standards. Everyone who doesn't follow them can be banned 
from the team and will be reported to the lecturer and therefore receive 0 marks.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies every time there is a group meeting, in Discord and in the Code Reviews.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at 40399682@live.napier.ac.uk. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
